# TODO Module


### Recommended Noteboook setup

Here is how I recommend setting up your notebooks in a nested structure:

- 1 Status
  - INBOX - Default notebook for new notes and TODOs.
  - NOW - TODOs from this Notebook are treated as the tasks to do right now. You should mark this notebook as "starred" so it shows up in the sidebar, your WP-Admin dashboard and on top in the WP-TODO mobile app.
  - LATER - TODOs from this Notebook are next in line to be done.
  - FollowUp - TODOs you need to follow up on - they are "handed off" to somebody right now.
