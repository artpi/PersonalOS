Notes module introduces 2 concepts:

- **Notebooks** which work like tags - collection of notes. They are also used for TODOs.
- **Notes** which are the actual notes you create.

Notes serve as a base for Readwise notes and Evernote notes.

### Organizing with Notebooks

Notebooks are used to organize your notes and TODOs. Any Note or TODO can be assigned to multiple notebooks. By default, it will end up in the "INBOX" notebook.

Notebooks show up in several places:

- In the [Notebooks taxonomy](edit-tags.php?taxonomy=notebook&post_type=notes).
- While editing a Note or TODO.
- In the WP-TODO mobile app sidebar.
- Starred notebooks show up in the sidebar.
- Starred notebooks show up in the dashboard.
- Notes synced via [Readwise](../readwise) or [Evernote](../evernote) modules will be automatically added to the corresponding notebooks.

### Recommended Noteboook setup

- INBOX - Default notebook for new notes and TODOs.
- NOW - TODOs from this Notebook are treated as the tasks to do right now. You should mark this notebook as "starred" so it shows up in the sidebar, your WP-Admin dashboard and on top in the WP-TODO mobile app.
- LATER - TODOs from this Notebook are next in line to be done.
