# WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards
Source: https://github.com/WordPress/wpcs-docs/blob/master/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript.md

The WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards adapt the jQuery JavaScript Style Guide with these key modifications:
- Single quotes for strings instead of double quotes
- Case statements indented within switch blocks
- Consistent function content indentation
- WordPress-specific whitespace rules
- 100-character line limit encouraged but not enforced

## Key Formatting Rules
- Indent with tabs, not spaces
- Liberal use of whitespace for readability
- Braces required for all blocks (if/else/for/while/try)
- Each statement on its own line
- Strict equality checks (`===`) over abstract equality (`==`)
- Single quotes for strings

## Variable Declaration
- ES2015+: Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed
- Pre-ES2015: Single `var` statement at top of function scope
- CamelCase for variables and functions
- UpperCamelCase for constructors and classes
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Code Organization
- Functions should be concise and focused
- Multi-line statements break after operators
- Comments precede relevant code with blank line before
- JSDoc format for documentation

## Best Practices
- Array creation with `[]`, not `new Array()`
- Object creation with `{}` unless specific prototype needed
- Store loop maximum in variable rather than recalculating
- Use Underscore.js collection methods for data transformations
- Only use jQuery each() for jQuery collections

## Tools
- JSHint for automated code quality checking
- Configuration in `.jshintrc` file
