The dev environment is managed by the `wp-env` package.
In order to run code and run tests, you need to use the proper syntax to run commands.

If you think the test environment failed DO NOT TRY TO FIX IT. Tell me.

## Testing Commands

- To run unit tests, you would `npm run test:unit:backend`
- To read the debug.log you would `npm run wp-env run cli -- tail -n 100 wp-content/debug.log`
- To run a wp-cli "wp pos" command you would do `npm run wp-env run cli wp pos`
