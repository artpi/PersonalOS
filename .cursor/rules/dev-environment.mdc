The dev environment is managed by the `wp-env` package.
In order to run code and run tests, you need to use the proper syntax to run commands.

## Testing Commands

- To run unit tests, you would `npm run test:unit`
- To read the debug.log you would `npm run wp-env run cli -- tail -n 100 wp-content/debug.log`
- To run a wp-cli "wp pos" command you would do `npm run wp-env run cli wp pos`
