The dev environment is managed by the `wp-env` package.
In order to run code and run tests, you need to use the proper syntax to run commands.

For example:

- To run unit tests, you would `npm run test:unit`
- To read the debug.log you would `npm run wp-env run cli -- tail -n 100 wp-content/debug.log`

Feel free to do both as often as you think is reasonable. DO NOT run local commands on this machine, as the wp-env manages the environment in a docker container.
