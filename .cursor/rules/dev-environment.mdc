The dev environment is managed by the `wp-env` package.
In order to run code and run tests, you need to use the proper syntax to run commands.

## Testing Commands

### Unit Tests
- To run all unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- To run specific unit test class: `npm run test:unit -- --filter=ClassName`
- Example: `npm run test:unit -- --filter=OpenAIModuleTest`

### Integration Tests
- Integration tests in this project are tests that run API calls to external APIs. All other tests are unit.
- To run all integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- To run specific integration test class: `npm run test:integration -- --filter=ClassName`
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT run integration tests automatically - only run when specifically requested

### Other Useful Commands
- To read the debug.log: `npm run wp-env run cli -- tail -n 100 wp-content/debug.log`
- To check PHP syntax/linting: Use the linter errors shown in the interface
- To run specific test groups: `npm run test:unit -- --group=groupname`

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Always run unit tests** after making code changes to verify functionality
2. **Run specific test classes** when working on particular modules (faster feedback)
3. **Only run integration tests** when specifically asked or when testing full system flows
4. **Feel free to run unit tests often** - they are fast and help catch regressions
5. **DO NOT run local commands** on this machine, as wp-env manages the environment in a docker container

## Test Structure
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` - Test individual methods and classes in isolation
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` - Test full workflows and system interactions
