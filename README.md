# Personal OS is the operating system for your life installed in your digital home.

A modern note-taking and productivity system built on WordPress with the latest and greatest WordPress features.

### Few principles

- Methodologies borrowed from Building a Second Brain, and GTD
- Inspired by Roam Research, Logseq, Obsidian and Tana
- Opinionated. I will ship features because I want them
- Has to work with any WordPress supporting plugins
- Implement things the WordPress Way™. WordPress has a ton of new APIs.

## Features

I consider this a humble start. I intend to grow this feature list until it becomes my main notetaking app.

- [TODOs](modules/todo/README.md) - Manage your TODOs right in WordPress or through a dedicated mobile app
- [Notes](modules/notes/README.md) - Fully private "note" CPT, with embeddable nesting
  - [Readwise](modules/readwise/README.md) - Sync notes with Readwise
  - [Evernote](modules/evernote/README.md) - Sync notes with Evernote via 2-way sync
  - [Transcriptions](modules/openai/README.md) - Upload an mp3 and it will get transcribed and turned into a note.
